🟦 DAY-1 — ARCHITECTURE & GROUNDWORK (FOUNDATION DAY)

Today we will do this -

1. Final system architecture (clear in your head + written)
2. Repo & folder restructuring plan
3. ML strategy locked (URL first)
4. Initial README committed (the one we finalized)
5. Dev environment ready

#1 System level Understanding

User
  ↓
React Frontend
  ↓
Flask Backend API
  ├── URL ML Model (local inference)
  ├── Text ML Model (local inference)
  └── Optional LLM Explainer

Note -> Key idea:

1. Frontend never talks to models
2. Backend owns inference
3. ML models are loaded once at startup
4. LLM never makes final decisions

Imp ** - This is architect-level design.

#2 Repo structuring

### Do this -
✅ Do these in order:

Rename project to sentinelai

Create folder structure (as above)

Move existing Flask code into backend/app/

Commit README (the final one)

Setup Python venv + deps

Stop. Do NOT start training yet.
